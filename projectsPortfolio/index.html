            <h2 style="color:rgb(211, 145, 23);">A little about us...</h2>
            <p> Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day to day operations. <br>
                We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast.
                We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism.
                We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
                You get on your bike, you ride, you fall, you might get pulled over, you overcome it all and you ride again. 
                It’s a Vicious Cycle! So make it worth the while, don't just be part of the numbers. Ride your cycle, chase your dreams, live your life.
                <p>We exhibit at several trade shows every year.  We are at home in the indoor showroom, but we believe the real showroom can only be found out on and off the road. Cycling is a lifestyle- Live Your Life</p>

            <h2 style="color:rgb(211, 145, 23);">What we offer...</h2>
            <p>When it comes to industry leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products are what you have been waiting for. We sell top quality cycling equipment and have been doing it for years. Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying us for some time. Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for second best when it comes to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust into, at a price you can afford. Of course, Custom Work is another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully-custom or customized build, come down to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do..<br>
            </p>
            <p>We don’t just customize bikes. We also sell stuff we know you’ll dig. Riding is a lifestyle, and we want to help you live your life. We carry Connodale and Trek products. Vicious Cycle products can be purchased/ordered at our store. Come down today and we'll get started with a purchase of an existing bike with cash, credit, or an in-house loan approval. All custom builds will require a 25% down payment before projects will begin, and either payment in full, or an approved in-house loan or a transfer of funds to a third-party vendor. All purchases on custom cycles are final.</p>
